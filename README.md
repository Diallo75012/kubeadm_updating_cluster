# KUBEADM OLD CLUSTER UPDATE

- Started the update:
- [x] get kubelet certificated renewed on controller node, worker node and get it running again without reseting the cluster
- [ ] update the versions until latest version of kubeadm (for the moment at v1.27.3) so many updates to do (cordon, unhold update, update, cordon)
- [ ] use the cluster to perform some tutorials while updating and after update
