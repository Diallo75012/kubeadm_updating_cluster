- `yoyogi-visitor/`: Here the folder is for if you are using `helm` commands so normal chart life.
- `charts/yoyogi-visitor/`: Here the folder is for if you are using `kustomize` `binary` or `kubectl kustomize.. --enable-helm` or `kubectl apply -k . --enable-helm`
   having all your charts folder in a `charts` folder is **mandatory**
